# Public Health Data Management: Core Analytical Results (SQL Project)

## Project Objective
This project demonstrates proficiency in foundational to intermediate SQL techniques focused entirely on extracting **direct, actionable metrics** from complex health survey data. The goal is to calculate key public health indicators for planning and resource allocation.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes a simulated health survey dataset containing patient demographics and chronic disease risk factors (e.g., BMI, Fasting Blood Sugar, Ethnicity).

## Key Analytical Results: Four Actionable Insights

This project showcases four critical insights, each generated by a specific SELECT query, representing direct answers to public health questions.

### 1. Metric Comparison: Obesity Risk (Query 3)
* **Query Goal:** Compare the **average BMI** between individuals with and without a diabetes diagnosis.
* **Public Health Action:** Provides a direct, comparative metric demonstrating the statistical association between obesity and disease status.

### 2. Health Equity and Prevalence Analysis (Query 9)
* **Query Goal:** Calculate the precise **diabetes prevalence rate** for each ethnicity category.
* **Public Health Action:** This provides a direct, actionable metric for identifying **health equity gaps** and guiding resource allocation toward the highest-risk demographic groups.

### 3. Geographical Targeting (Query 11)
* **Query Goal:** Identify the specific **County** with the highest count of individuals with diabetes.
* **Public Health Action:** Pinpoints the top geographical area for immediate resource concentration, demonstrating the ability to prioritize local intervention efforts.

### 4. Cohort Identification for Intervention (Query 12)
* **Query Goal:** Identify individuals with a high number of Doctor Visits (10 or more) AND no family history of diabetes.
* **Public Health Action:** This complex filtering helps isolate a specific high-priority cohort for a focused study—for example, targeting individuals whose risk is purely environmental or lifestyle-based.

## Technical Setup
* **Language**: SQL (Standard)  
* **Data**: diabetes\_health\_data.csv  

### Instructions for Review

The **`Diabetes_Health_Queries.sql`** file contains a sequence of 12 pure SELECT queries that generate immediate results.
